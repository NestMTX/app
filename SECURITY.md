# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At NestMTX, we take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you believe you have found a vulnerability in our application, we ask you to report it responsibly.

To report a security vulnerability, please use the GitHub "Report a Security Vulnerability" link available at the following URL: [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/NestMTX/app/security/advisories/new). This will guide you through the process of creating a confidential security advisory that will not be visible to the public.

### Guidelines for Reporting:
- **Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly** until we have confirmed and addressed the issue.
- **Provide as much information as possible**, including any relevant details about the vulnerability, steps to reproduce the issue, and the potential impact.
- We aim to acknowledge your report as quickly as possible and provide regular updates on the status of the vulnerability as we work to resolve it.

## Supported Versions

We support security updates for the following versions of our software:

- Latest stable release (most recent major version)
- Previous major version (where applicable)

Once a vulnerability has been addressed, we will issue a new release and notify the community.

Thank you for helping to keep NestMTX and our community secure!
